Most elements now have rounded borders, making the design look more modern (dare I say "Stripe-ified") than ever before. 

## asd 

The goal of Hydejack was always to provide a theme that looks "designed" combined the amenities of a typical Jekyll theme for coders.
This is an important step in maintaining this goal.

At the same time, I'm introducing nerdy elements like [breadcrumbs](#serp-breadcrumbs), that are almost ornamental in nature.
You wouldn't find these on other Stripe-like designs, but I think they are appealing to developer types like myself. 
Like most additions to Hydejack, they can be disabled via configuration.
